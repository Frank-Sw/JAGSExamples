# Learning JAGS through Examples
Each example consists of four parts:

- A generator, which produces simulated data.
- A data file, which stores the data set in CSV format.
- A BUGS file, which describes the statistical model in the BUGS language.
- A script, which loads the data and performs inference using the `rjags` package.
